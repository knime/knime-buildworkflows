	<name>Workflow Executor</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Executes a workflow as part of this workflow.
		The workflow to be executed is provided at the workflow input port.
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Executes a workflow provided at the workflow input port as part of this workflow.
		</intro>
	<option name="Inputs &amp; outputs adjustment">
		Allows one to automatically adjust the node ports with respect to the inputs
		and outputs of the workflow given at the input port.
		The automatic port adjustments can be undone (undo operation).
		<br/>
		The input and output ports of the node must match the inputs and outputs of the workflow
		(not taking 0th flow variable ports and the workflow in-port into account).
	</option>
	<option name="Debugging: Show executing workflow segment">If enabled the executing workflow will be
		visible as part of a metanode next to this node. By stepping into the metanode the ongoing execution
		can be inspected. If the workflow fails to execute and this option is enabled, the metanode will
		remain in order to be able to identify the problem.
		<br/>
		If the option is disabled the actual executing workflow won't be visible.
	</option>
	<option name="Update links of components and metanodes">
		If enabled, linked components and metanodes contained in the given workflow segment will be updated before execution.

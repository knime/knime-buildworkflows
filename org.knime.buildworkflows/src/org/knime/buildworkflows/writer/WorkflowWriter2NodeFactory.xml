				General settings regarding the output file location and formats.

			<option name="Write to">
				Select a file system in which you want to store the file.
				There are three default file system options to choose from:
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li><i>Local File System:</i>
					    Allows you to select a location in your local system.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Mountpoint:</i>
	                    Allows you to write to a mountpoint.
	                	When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
	                	Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected
	                	(note that browsing is disabled in this case).
	                	Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
	                	A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
	                	You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Relative to:</i>
	                    Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area.
	                    When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the three options to use.
	                </li>
				</ul>
				It is possible to use other file systems with this node.
				Therefore, you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node by clicking the <b>...</b> in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose <i>Add File System Connection port</i>.
				<br />
				Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this node.
				The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
				It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you have to (re)execute the connector node first.
				Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file system is provided via the input port.
			</option>
			<option name="Folder">
				Enter a path to a folder.
				The required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint).
				For file systems connected via input port, the node description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
				You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down list, or select a location from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
				Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
				<ul>
					<li><i>Mountpoint:</i>
					    Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
					    Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
					</li>
					<li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
					    Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
					    (Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.
					</li>
				</ul>
                <i>The location can be exposed as or automatically set via a

                <i>path flow variable.</i></a>
			</option>
			<option name="Create missing folders">
			    Select if the folders of the selected output location should be created if they do not already exist.
			    If this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not exist.
			</option>
			<option name="If exists">
				Specify the behavior of the node in case the output file already exists.
				<ul>
					<li><i>Overwrite:</i>
					    Will replace any existing workflow.
					</li>
					<li><i>Fail:</i>
					    Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent unintentional overwrite).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			<option name="Use custom workflow name">
				If checked, a custom workflow name is used as specified below.
				Otherwise the default workflow name, as shown above, is used.
			</option>
			<option name="Custom workflow name">
				A customizable name for the to-be-written workflow.
			</option>
			<option name="Write workflow">
				If selected, the workflow will be written into a folder and the KNIME Explorer view will be refreshed.
			</option>
			<option name="Write workflow and open in explorer">
				If selected, the workflow will be written into a folder, the KNIME Explorer view will be refreshed and the written workflow will be opened in KNIME Analytics Platform.
			</option>
			<option name="Export workflow as knwf archive">
				If selected, he workflow will be written as a .knwf archive, just as if it were exported from KNIME Analytics Platform.
				This archive can be imported into other installations of KNIME Analytics Platform.
			</option>

		<tab name="Inputs and outputs">
			<option name="Add input node">
			    Allows one to add input nodes connected to selected inputs prior writing.
				Depending on the selected node, there is a limited set of options available to pre-configure the node to be added.
				Furthermore, if tabular input data is stored with the input, it is used as examples input data for added input nodes.

		<intro>
			Marks the start of a to be captured workflow fragment. The
			entire
			workflow within the scope of a 'Capture Workfow Start'- and
			'Capture
			Workflow End'-node
			is captured and available at the workflow
			output port
			of the 'Capture Workflow End'-node.

			Nodes that have
			out-going connections to a node that is
			part of the scope but
			aren't
			part of the scope themselves are
			represented as static inputs
			(but not
			captured).

	<shortDescription>Concatenates two workflow segments.</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Allows to connect various workflows into one workflow.
			Free
			output
			ports
			from one workflow are connected to the free input ports
			of the
			consecutive workflow.
			The actual pairing of those output and
			input
			ports can be configured.

			<br />
			Please note that the workflow name as well as the workflow editor
			settings (such as grid or
			connection
			settings) of the result workflow
			will be inherited from the
			workflow
			at
			the first input port.
		</intro>
		<tab name="Workflow Connections">
			<option name="Connect workflow i with (i+1)">
				For each pair of consecutive workflows (in the order of the workflow
				ports), select if and how to connect the outputs of the first
				workflow to the inputs of the second workflow.
				<br />
				<b>Default configuration:</b>
				By default (i.e. if
				not configured otherwise)
				the
				inputs
				of each
				workflow will be
				automatically connected with
				the
				outputs of the
				predecessor workflow, i.e., the workflow
				connected to the previous
				input port. The
				<tt>i-th</tt>
				output
				of workflow
				<tt>j</tt>
				will be connected to the
				<tt>i-th</tt>
				input of workflow
				<tt>j+1</tt>
				.
				If the default pairing of inputs and outputs cannot be applied (because of a
				non-matching number of inputs and outputs or incompatible port
				types), the node can not be executed and requires manual
				configuration.
				<br />
				<b>Manual configuration:</b>
				If the default configuration is not applicable or not desired, the
				output to input pairing can be chosen manually. This is
				done by selecting the outputs that are to be connected to an
				inputs of the subsequent workflow. Only compatible port types
				are eligible.
